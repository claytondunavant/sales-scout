No marketing.
Just yard sales.

This is a re-writing of a past project I had in the MERN stack.
The past iteration of Sales Scout had a frontend of pure HTML, CSS, and PHP with a backend written in Python with a MySQL database.
The purpose of this project is futher my experience with modern web-app development and to put a valuable service back on the internet.

I created this service because I found it very helpful, and I hope you find it helpful too.
